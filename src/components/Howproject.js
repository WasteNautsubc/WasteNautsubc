      <p1>HOW OUR PROJECTS ARE SELECTED? </p1>
      <p2>Our team has a robust system of selecting projects every design cycle (2 terms). This is done through an intensive 4-week technical assessments round. Here, project lead applicants aspiring to become sub-team leads work on developing their idea into a pitch through the help of execs and their fellow applicants. After which, they provide a 10-15 minute pitch and prepare a research compilation for the exec team to review.

The review period takes approximately one week, where scores are put into a robust Weighted Decision Matrix to obtain final results.</p2>
